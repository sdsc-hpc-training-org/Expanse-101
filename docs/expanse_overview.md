## Expanse Overview:

### HPC for the *long tail* of science:
* Designed by Dell and SDSC delivering 5.16 peak petaflops
* Designed and operated on the principle that the majority of computational research is performed at modest scale: large number jobs that run for less than 48 hours, but can be computationally intensvie and generate large amounts of data.
* An NSF-funded system available through the eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) program (https://www.xsede.org).
* Supports interactive computing and science gateways.
* Will offer Composible Systems and Cloud Bursting.
