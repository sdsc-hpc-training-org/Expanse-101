## Expanse Overview:

### HPC for the "long tail of science:"
* Designed and operated on the principle that the majority of computational research is performed at modest scale: large number jobs that run for less than 48 hours, but can be computationally intensvie and generate large amounts of data.
* An NSF-funded system available through the eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) program.
* Also supports science gateways.
